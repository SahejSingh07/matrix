# Welcome

Programming is hard. Nope it's not, that is a very funny statement to make actually. Do you remember when you learnt the alphabet for the first time in kindergarten? Those took a whole year, and tell me, are the alphabet hard? 

Programming is very similar. Easy, but with a little bit of practise.

```python
print("Hello World")
```
